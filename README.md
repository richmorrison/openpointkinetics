# openpointkinetics
## A simple point kinetics solver ideal for introducing this fundamental theory in Nuclear Reactor Analysis.

### Introduction to Point Kinetics Theory

The *Point Kinetics Equations* provide a description of the behaviour of a nuclear reactor as a function of time. These equations don't tell us anything about the shape of the neutron flux, but can provide us with a very general description of how quickly a nuclear reactor responds to a reactivity addition or give us an idea of how much time is available to an operator to make control adjustments. With some modification the equations provided by point kinetics theory can teach us about the effects of thermal feedback on reactor behaviour.

### Code Purpose

This code was developed to provide a framework for aspiring Nuclear Engineers to take their first steps in learning about Reactor Analysis. It is hoped that this code will also provide an opportunity to for students to learn about various numerical methods, which are slowly being added to this code as a series of plugins for review and inspection. With some thought this code code be used to generate some exercises for Physics, Engineering, Maths and Computing students.

### Where to learn more about Point Kinetics

I recommend the textbook *Nuclear Reactor Analysis* by *James J. Duderstadt* and *Louis J. Hamilton* (Chapter 6).
